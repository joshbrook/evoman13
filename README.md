This repo contains the code accompanying our paper, 

*A Comparative Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Game-Playing Agent Evolution:*
*CMA-ES vs. a Custom EA in the EVOMAN Framework*

Using the Evoman framework, we test, analyse, and compare the fitness of two competing algorithms, one based on CMA-ES and one created from the ground up by us, on 3 levels of the Evoman game.

Evoman is a video game playing framework to be used as a testbed for optimization algorithms.
